\section{Recurrent GNN - Pritheshwar's task}
Recurrent GNN are the first Graph Neural Networks proposed as early as 2005. 
GNN can categorized in 3 types based on the task:
\subsection{Node-level Task}
In a node level task each node is represented by vector called embedding and the goal here to characterize the node or predict the features if the node. 
Ex: Given a society of individuals predict where a particular person smokes or not 
\subsection{edge level}
In an edge level task the goal is to predict top N possible edges from the interaction in the current graph.
Ex: Recomendation Systems: We have a graph of users and items the task is to recommend new products or videos for the users.
Predicting the time taken to reach a destination in google maps.

\subsection{Graph level}
These tasks involve extracting useful information from the graph.
Ex: Given a molecular structure which is the graph of atoms and bonds predict the aroma of the compund 

Note: AlphaFold 
Google's deepmind has build a model to predict the structure of the protein for a given aminoacids by modeling the interaction to be a Graph Neural Network.
