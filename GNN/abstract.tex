\begin{abstract}
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for graph-structured data, enabling tasks like node and graph classification, and link prediction. GNNs can capture complex relationships and patterns. We give an overview of GNNs and an abstraction to represent different flavours of GNN like Graph Convolutional Network and Graph Attention Networks. Finally, an example, with code and explanations, is also given.
