\subsection{General Recipe}
So, the basic recipe for a GNN is
\begin{enumerate}
  %\item Identify the graph structure that you want to apply GNN on i.e, formulate the nodes and edges in the data.
  \item Construct the initial graph structure to model the data as nodes and the relationship between data as edges
  \item Based on the task i.e, node level, edge level as described earlier, create the GNN model's classification layer
  \item Define the loss function according to the context. Eg: log likelihood, root mean square error etc.
  \item Apply gradient descent and optimize the weight parameters by minimizing the loss function
\end{enumerate}
