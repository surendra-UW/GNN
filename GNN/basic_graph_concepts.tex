\section{Basic Graph Concepts}

\begin{quote}
    A graph G = (V, E) consists of a set of nodes (vertices) V and a set of edges E
\end{quote}
    
%\end{displayquote}

Each edge connects two nodes and represents the relationship between the two nodes. Graphs can be directed (edges have a direction) as shown in Figure \ref{Directed_Graph} (page \pageref{Directed_Graph}) or undirected (edges have no direction) as shown in Figure \ref{Undirected_Graph} (page \pageref{Undirected_Graph}). Additionally, graphs can be weighted, where edges have an associated weight representing the strength of the connection between the nodes.

Graphs are represented using the adjacency matrix A where each element in the matrix $A_{ij}$ represent the weight of edge from $node_i$ to $node_j$.

A degree of node can be defined as the number of neighbour nodes $N(v)$. 

\begin{quote}
    Note : \textit{Nodes} and \textit{edges} are very general terms and can mean a lot of things. For example, a node itself could be a Deep Neural Network and an edge could represent a producer-consumer relationship, evolutionary relationship, a chemical bond, a dataflow relationship or even a mechanical connection.

\subsection{Modelling Using Graphs}
%\begin{quote}
Graphs allow for the most flexible and accurate representation of a lot of modelling problems. In general, engineering involves the creation of a model with certain (reasonable) assumptions. The objective of creating a model is to ultimately utilise the model for its predictive capabilities. Thus, the modelling framework or approach we take, influences both the way we see a problem and also its solution. A good number of problems that we are trying to solve can be represented as a graph model - 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Social Media Networks - where every individual is modelled as node and their relation is the edge between them 
    \item Molecules - Every atom is a node and the bond between them is an edge
    \item Proteins - Proteins are represented as a graph (G) of Aminoacids (N) connected to each other by an edge (E)
\end{enumerate}
